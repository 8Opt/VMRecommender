# VMRec

## Getting started

This project aims to build a dynamic network diagram generator using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. By leveraging a database of VM types, we'll design a workflow that takes customer specifications as input and produces an output representing a complete network diagram. This includes the allocation of virtual machines, VLAN configuration, and the specific details of each chosen machine type. This approach promises a highly automated and flexible solution for creating tailored network diagrams based on customer needs.
